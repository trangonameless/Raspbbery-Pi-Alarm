This code runs on a Raspberry Pi where a camera, PIR motion detector is connected to IO 04, and an LED to IO 21. It can be used as a burglary alarm.
You run the program, after the time you entered has passed alarm is armed.
When any movement is detected by the PIR motion detector, the camera captures a potential burglar, and the photo is sent to your email address.
